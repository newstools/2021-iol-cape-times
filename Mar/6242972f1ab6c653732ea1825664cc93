Cape Town – A Factreton resident and soccer coach has claimed that his complaint, lodged to the City of Cape Town, about a water leak in the sports field they use for tournaments every Sundays, has fallen on deaf ears. Hilton Williams, 47,  says he lodged the complaint with the City in November, but no one came to fix the pipe that had burst in the sports field situated in Dapper Road, adjacent to Factreton primary school. “It’s fresh clear water running because of a pipe that burst. They gave me a reference number and that's it. Still, today, the water runs. I have reported this but it's fallen on deaf ears,” Williams said. The City said they were looking into the matter yesterday: “Please note that the department is looking into this matter and we will respond as soon as we have the relevant information.” Williams said he first noticed the burst water pipe in late October last year, while busy training on the field with his team of children, and reported it immediately when nothing was being done. “This is a community field that we use on a Sunday’s to play soccer tournaments. They are saying ’the City works for you’ but the City has failed us for not coming out to fix the problem. “So we, as the community, ask for their assistance to fix the field for the children, as I am doing my best to keep the children on the right path,” he said. Community activist Kevin Alexander said the water leak has been there for months now. “It was first reported in November 2020. In February, we followed up and reported it once again. On Sunday, we went to check and the water is still running. “Not so long ago, we came out of water restrictions. Also, in other parts of Factreton, there are informal settlements without running water,” he said. Cape Times
