Resident Asipe Mbekweni said: “I was on my way to visit one of my friends when I saw two or three people staring at something. “When I got there I saw the dumped body of a man. I could see the stab wounds. “Some people say the man does not live in the area, he would just come visit, but he was dumped here because this is where most things are being dumped. “The reason for the death is unknown but people suspect he may have been robbed because he was seen walking late alone and that is the time people are being robbed.’’ Anyone with information relating to the matter can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
