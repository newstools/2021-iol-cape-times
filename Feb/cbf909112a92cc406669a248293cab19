Cape Town – Police are investigating a malicious damage to property case after the Bait Ul Awal Masjied in Athlone was pelted with eggs last week. The Cape Town Interfaith Initiative (CTII) and Western Cape Religious Leaders’ Forum (WCRLF) said that at around 10pm on Tuesday, four cars drove slowly past the Bait Ul Awal Masjied and an occupant of one of the vehicles was seen to pelt the Masjied with eggs. The cars then drove off. The CTII and WCRLF said they were deeply saddened by the incident and had reported the matter to police. “While the incident itself is minor, the sinister undertones of premeditated violence against the community are cause for serious concern particularly as it occurs in a context of ongoing harassment,” the organisations said in a joint statement. WCRLF chair Archdeacon Mark Long said: “History has taught us that small acts of contempt left unchecked turn easily to more damaging violence, conflict and loss. ’’We are therefore compelled to call out such actions of separation, particularly in this time of pandemic where additional stress on a community is not only criminal and cruel, but also potentially highly inflammatory.” CTII chairperson Reverend Berry Behr said the Covid-19 pandemic had highlighted the need for humans in all their diversity to work together for the security and survival of people and the planet. “People have every right to be who they are and to practise what they believe, but nobody has the right to hurt others,” Behr said. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said: “No arrests have yet been made and the investigation continues.” Cape Times
