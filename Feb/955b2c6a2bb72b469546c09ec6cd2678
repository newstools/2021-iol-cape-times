Cape Town - Langa Safety Patrollers have been hailed for their efforts in following up on a report that led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man accused of the murder of Luyanda Pentle. According to police, the man had been on the run since last Monday following the discovery of Pentle’s lifeless body wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a bag. The 33-year-old had been stabbed to death. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the suspect was arrested on a murder charge on Friday and is expected to appear in the Bishop Lavis magistrates’ court today. Langa Safety Patrol member Ntsikelelo Camagu said they have been assisting police to trace the accused after neighbours spotted the man at night, passing by his home in a rush. “The accused had been staying alone at his home for a while after his sick mother left to be taken care off by his relatives. During the day, on Tuesday, the family came to clean the stench, fetch the furniture and other possessions that were in the house and lock it up. So we assume he wanted to return but saw there was no one. He had nowhere else to go. “We had informed residents about the incident and urged them to inform us or the police, when he is seen. We received a tip-off that someone who looked liked him was by the taxi rank and we immediately went there. When we caught him, we called the police who arrested him,” said Camagu. Pentle’s mother Ntombizodwa Makeleni, who last saw her son leaving their Zone 4 home last Saturday morning, said the family welcomed the arrest. “We can prepare our funeral arrangements in peace knowing he is arrested. We know that there was a fight that happened but don’t know what led to the fight or why the accused, who is supposed to be his friend, would hide his body and let it rot like that,” said Makeleni. okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za Cape Times
