Cape Town – There was mixed support at the Atlantis Magistrate’s Court yesterday, where a top cop in the area appeared on a charge of sexual harassment. The station commander has been accused of sexually harassing a female officer, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) in the Western Cape said, as they gathered at the court to support their member. There was also support for the officer, with some people saying he was being falsely accused. Popcru said their picket was in protest against gender-based violence and sexual harassment. “It’s a shame when those who are supposed to uphold the law are alleged to be transgressors themselves. We call upon the removal of Colonel (name being withheld) at Atlantis SAPS,” Popcru said. Popcru GBV co-ordinator Busi Matika condemned the alleged incident, and said everyone needs to stand up against such incidents. “We are here to support our member who was sexually harassed, we condemn sexual harassment in any form. We know that a person is not guilty until the case is closed, but we are here to support her. “As the president said, we can not keep quiet when (attacks) on women occur,” Matika said. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said a case of sexual harassment was reported against an officer, and the suspect was expected in court yesterday. “It is SAPS policy to conduct a departmental investigation following any misconduct or criminal investigation against a member, however this is an internal process between the employer and the employee and dealt with as such,” he said when asked on the status of Limido’s employment. Outside court, there was more support for the commander, with some supporters saying he was being targeted and falsely accused. After a brief court appearance, supporters of the accused escorted him to his car. The case has been postponed to March 9. Cape Times
