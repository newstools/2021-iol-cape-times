There have been a further 110 Covid-19 related deaths deaths: Eastern Cape 8, Free State 20, Gauteng 23, KwaZulu-Natal 10, Mpumalanga 20, Northern Cape 1 and Western Cape 28 which brings the total to 46 290 deaths.   "Our recoveries now stand at  1 360 204, representing a recovery rate of 92%," the Ministry said. AstraZeneca vaccine provides minimal protection against Covid-19 variant The AstraZeneca vaccine provides minimal protection against mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms from the variant first discovered in South Africa, Professor Shabir Madhi, Dean of Health Sciences at Wits University, confirmed on Sunday. Madhi, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and the Health Committee were addressing the media on the latest research on Covid-19 vaccines and South Africaâ€™s roll-out strategy. While the AstraZeneca vaccine had high efficacy against the original coronavirus, it offers limited protection against the 501Y.V2 variant, Madhi said. In this study of approximately 2,000 volunteers, protection against moderate-severe disease, hospitalisation or death could not be assessed in this study as the target population were at low risk.
