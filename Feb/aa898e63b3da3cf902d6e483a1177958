Cape Town – The search for a missing woman who either fell or jumped from the top of Table Mountain came to an end yesterday when her body was discovered by search teams. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “The body of an unidentified woman was found on Table Mountain this afternoon. “The identity of the deceased will be known once a DNA test is conducted.” Emergency Medical Services (EMS) said that the rescue team located the body at 1.30pm. EMS spokesperson Deanna Bessick said: “The woman presumably fell or jumped from the top of Table Mountain. “The EMS drone was initially deployed at 8.35am (yesterday morning), and thorough drone flight searches were conducted. “The body was eventually found by the EMS rescue team who assisted with the search by foot, as there were bushes that obstructed the view of the drone technician.” Bessick said that the woman had been missing since Monday, and a missing person’s report had been filed with the police in Stellenbosch. “She was seen walking up the mountain on Friday, and her bag was found early on Saturday on top of the mountain in the Fountain Ravine area,” Bessick said. EMS extended its condolences to the family and friends of the woman. South African National Parks spokesperson Lauren Clayton said the details leading up to her death were not yet known, and that she could not confirm if the woman had jumped or fell. Wilderness Search and Rescue spokesperson Johann Marais confirmed teams had been assisting with the search. Cape Times
