Cape Town – Premier Alan Winde said he was overwhelmed with gratitude towards Western Cape residents and its healthcare workers, as the data showed a decline in the second wave of Covid-19 infections. He expressed his gratitude after the Western Cape cabinet received its weekly update on the Covid-19 situation on Wednesday. Winde said after looking at the data, he was grateful for everything residents and healthcare workers had done to save lives and ensure a sustained decline of the second wave. All the key Covid-19 indicators have shown significant downward trends. Winde said: “The second wave we experienced in the Western Cape was severe – surpassing the peak of the first wave – primarily driven by the new, highly transmissible variant of the virus. This caused enormous pressure on health platforms during this time. “The Western Cape government and our partners have worked hard to provide the resources – beds, staff and oxygen needed to ensure that we could manage the peak of the second wave. We did not run out of any of these crucial life-saving resources.” He added this could not have been done without Western Cape residents and the brave healthcare workers. "Every single person has contributed to these reductions and we can all be very proud.“ The premier said while the province would soon start rolling out the first batches of vaccines, it would take time for the province to vaccinate enough people to achieve herd immunity. “In the meantime, we should all continue to be cautious – wear your mask, keep up good hand and surface hygiene and avoid close contact with others. We have lived with this pandemic for almost a year and every single one of our lives have changed. “We must continue to do everything we can to achieve the balance we need to protect ourselves and our loved ones, while also ensuring that people are able to return to work and school, to earn a living and to access healthcare and other government services.” Cape Argus
