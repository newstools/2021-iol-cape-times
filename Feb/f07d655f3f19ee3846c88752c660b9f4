Cape Town - A Business and Management Science student will finally be able to prove he completed his course after a “lapse in administration processes between departments” led to an unnecessary delay in him receiving his documentation. Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) student Menelisi Gxogxa said the hiccup had cost him dearly in his quest to find a job. The 26-year-old accused the academic staff of not helping him accordingly after he was sent from pillar to post trying to get a letter confirming completion of his management course while awaiting graduation. “I requested a letter of completion or qualifying letter from the institution in early January because I wanted to apply for jobs. To date, I have not received the letter. ’’Last week, someone from the institution sent me a graduation qualifying letter request form which I signed and returned immediately, but I was surprised to see that he had failed to sign and forward the letter to the relevant department, and it’s been seven days now. “I lost a job opportunity due to this; the company I had applied to was graceful enough to extend the due date for the submission of the letter, but I ended up losing out because the letter was never sent to me.” Gxogxa said it had taken an emotional toll on him. The university said that an investigation was going to be launched by the involved departments. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said: “I can confirm that Menelisi Gxogxa has been issued with the confirmation of graduation letter which he has been requesting. “Unfortunately, we appreciate that a lapse in administration processes between departments has led to an unnecessary delay in him receiving the required document. ’’The heads of the respective departments involved will launch an investigation to determine why his request was not handled more proactively.” Cape Times
