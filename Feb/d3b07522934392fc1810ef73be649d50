Cape Town – A group of residents intent on taking back their community from criminals eradicated alien vegetation that has become a notorious hiding place at Sir Lowry's Pass Village. The group – consisting of residents from Donne Estate, Sir Lowry's Pass Farm Watch, and the Somerset Community Policing Forum (CPF) – eradicated alien trees from erf 1 438 Sir Lowry's Pass Village, using chainsaws, bow saws, axes, loppers and pangas, with the aim of clearing the area. Organiser and Farm Watch member Gary Fraser said the bushes were used as a hiding place for thieves who rob workers on their way home. “These muggings occur more frequently when the bush is overgrown. It has also aided the escape of people breaking into homes in our local community. “The increase in crime on our estate, which is opposite the bush we cleared, has been the worst in the last 20 years. But the main reason is that of the mugging of our Sir Lowry's Pass villagers, who are targeted in the mornings while going to work, and in the afternoons after work. It is particularly bad on Fridays and at month end,” he said. Somerset West CPF vice chairperson Sue Buckland said volunteers came out in their numbers to assist. “There will always be opportunistic crime but what occurs here frequently is an attack and theft of valuables from those who are walking to or returning from work. “These attacks are sometimes associated with violence if the victims resist. “There is planning involved, but they are randomly done and as the scene of attacks varies these perpetrators are never caught. ’’So by removing the shield of the vegetation, Gary's group has effectively stopped the possibility of such crime being committed in the future,” she said.
