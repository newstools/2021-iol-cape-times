Cape Town - In a tragic start to the new year, a 16-year-old was shot and killed allegedly by her 23-year-old ex-boyfriend. The suspect will make his first court appearance at the Muizenberg Magistrate's Court today. Ashanti Fisher was killed in Lavender Hill on New Year's morning, and her distraught mother Melissa Fisher said she did not know how to cope but she was taking it one day at a time. “I lost my daughter Ashanti… killed by two gunshots on New Year's day. As a mother all I can say is I don't deserve it, as a single parent I don't deserve it. To lose a child of 16, I raised her alone. There was no one, just my mom when she was alive. Looking at our home it's empty, I can't describe how I am feeling,” Fisher said. “It is still a puzzle what exactly happened because I was working the night shift,” Fisher said. She said the two had been dating since August last year and broke up around the end of November. “I was not in favour of the relationship. He had told me he was no longer involved in gangsterism and appeared to be a quiet boy,” Fisher said, further alleging her daughter was abused by the man. She said her daughter would have started Grade 11 this year. Fisher cautioned parents and young girls to stay away from a relationship in which a partner may be involved in gangsterism. “It's not worth it, if you are in then you are in. Look at where my child is today. I heard her voice two minutes past (midnight) when I wished her happy New Year and death separated us without her even hugging me.” “To have her life taken away like that, the wound in my heart nobody can take away.” Fisher called for justice through the legal system for her daughter. Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed the arrest. “On (January 1) at 9.45am a 16-year-old female was shot and killed in Edward Road Hillview. “The suspect, a 23-year-old man was arrested and is due to make a court appearance in Muizenberg,” he said. nicola.daniels@inl.co.za Cape Times
