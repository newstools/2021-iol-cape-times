Cape Town – The department of agriculture in the Western Cape announced on Tuesday it was mourning the loss of its former member of the executive council, Gerrit van Rensburg. It is still unclear how Van Rensburg, who held the post from 2009 until 2014, died. In a statement, current MEC Dr Ivan Meyer said Van Rensburg had distinguished himself as “a true leader, a gentleman, a servant leader”. “He fully appreciated the role and contribution of the agri-worker,” Meyer said. He said Van Rensburg exponentially grew the Western Cape Farm Worker of the Year competition and recognised the advisory role the Agri-Workers Prestige Forum could play in building agriculture in the province. During his tenure, the department of agriculture received numerous accolades, including being crowned by the Southern African Institute for Government Auditors for providing the best annual reporting in the country for three consecutive years between 2011 and 2013. Meyer said Van Rensburg made a significant contribution to the growth and development of agriculture within the Western Cape and was known for championing the rights of the sector and promoting support for it. Under his leadership, in 2013 the Western Cape agriculture sector increased job opportunities from 16.4% of total agricultural opportunities in the country to 19.7%, pushing the province to top position in terms of employment creation. “We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Christa and the family and friends of the late Oom Gerrit van Rensburg,” Meyer said.
