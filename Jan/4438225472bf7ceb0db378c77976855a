With just over a week to go until the end of January, and the awaited arrival of the first batch of one million Covid-19 vaccines, South Africans are anticipating a more detailed vaccine roll-out plan. President Cyril Ramaphosa has called the vaccine drive “the largest and most complex logistical undertaking in our country’s history”.
