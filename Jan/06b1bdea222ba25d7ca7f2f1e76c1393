Cape Town - Premier Alan Winde has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa, calling on him to reconvene the President’s Coordinating Council (PCC) and urgently lift some of the restrictions in the Western Cape. Winde said that this is a matter of urgency and so that the province can avoid an economic disaster. Last week Tuesday, Winde wrote to Minister of Health Dr Zweli Mkhize, calling for an easing of restrictions. The premier said that included in the formal submission they set out "clear evidence in support of the changing of some restrictions". Winde said he had yet to receive a response from Mkhize. The Western Cape requested these changes be made urgently: “We are fast approaching a month since the adjusted alert level 3 restrictions came into effect,” Winde said. “At the time, it was made clear by the president that these restrictions would be in place for 14 days and thereafter reviewed, considering the evidence. “Twenty-eight days later, the evidence now clearly points to a different situation in our province.” He said the province had seen a sustained decline in active cases, hospitalisations, test positivity rate, oxygen usage and health-care worker infections. “Throughout this pandemic, we have argued for getting balance right in saving both lives and jobs, and we have not hesitated to take action in getting that balance right over the last year,” Winde said. “The reality is that the balance is not being achieved currently and that the president needs to use the differentiated approach to help save jobs in the Western Cape and those provinces that have clearly passed their peak.” The Presidency’s spokesperson Tyrone Seale said: “The Presidency has received Premier Winde’s request and this matter is under consideration.” Cape Argus
