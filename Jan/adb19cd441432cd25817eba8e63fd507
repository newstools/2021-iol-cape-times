Cape Town -  The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) has identified the two victims of assault by anti-gang unit (AGU) members in Worcester, which was captured on a video that circulated on social media. On Thursday, IPID spokesperson Ndileka Cola said the directorate has identified the victims in the 30-second clip. “They are seen in the video footage being slapped, searched and sjambokked by AGU members. The victims have opened a case at Worcester Police Station”. The footage shows an officer whipping the first victim with a sjambok while another slaps the second victim. She said this followed IPID identifying the AGU members captured in the footage. Cola said the directorate continued to investigate the case. On Wednesday, the EFF in the Western Cape condemned what they called the “inhumane action” of the AGU officers. “EFF Western Cape condemns in the harshest possible terms the inhumane action of the police officers who are seen in video slapping and sjambokking two men in Worcester. We call on those officers to be brought to book,” the party tweeted. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said further investigation into the matter was expected to shed light on what had happened prior to the recording commencing.
